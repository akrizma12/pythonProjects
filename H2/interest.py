# Exercise 7 at the end of HTT2 gives a Python program that computes compound interest.
# The provided code does this by using a formula using the exponentiation operator **: b**n == b*b*...b (n times).
# Rewrite this program without using this ** operator.  Use a for-loop to compute r = b**n in the following way:
# r = 1
# for counter in range (n):
#     r = r * b
# You may assume that n is always an int value.
